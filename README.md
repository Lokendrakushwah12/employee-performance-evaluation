Technical Implementation
The dashboard is built with:

Next.js for the framework
Tailwind CSS for styling
shadcn/ui components for the interface elements
React hooks for state management
Custom algorithm implementations for FOL, CSP, and heuristic backtracking

All algorithms are modular and reusable, making it easy to extend the dashboard with additional features or modify the evaluation criteria.
To run this dashboard, you would:

Set up a Next.js project
Install the required dependencies
Copy the component structure and code
Start the development server with npm run dev

This implementation is flexible enough to handle real JSON data by simply replacing the sample data in the lib/data.js file with your actual employee data.
